<h1>Email template guide</h1>

<p>
The template supports these tags:
	
<XMP>
	<<AuthorName>> - Name of the author, taken from configuration file.
	<<UserName>>   - Name of the user the email is being sent to.
</XMP>

<br/>

It is possible to use conditional <i>if-then-else</i> statement like this:
<XMP>
	<<If>>
	  [Condition in one line, see below]
	<<Then>>
	  [Text can take up more 
	          than one line]
	<<Else>>
	  [Text can take up more 
	          than one line]
	<</If>>
</XMP>

<br/>
The condition can be made up from these boolean operators:

<XMP>
	And (arg1) (arg2) - is True when both arguments are True
	Or  (arg1) (arg2) - is True when at least one argument is True
	Not (arg1)        - negates argument

	~ note that the arguments are written in parentheses ~
</XMP>

<br/>
You can use these arguments:

<XMP>
	True      - returns True
	False     - returns False
	isStudent - returns True if the user's role is Student
	isTA      - returns True if the user's role is TA
	isProf    - returns True is the user's role is Professor
</XMP>

<br/>

A sample email template might look something like:

<XMP>
	  Hello <<UserName>>,

	<<If>>
	  Not (isProf)
	<<Then>>
	  You are either a student or a teaching assistant.
	  Therefore you get this email body.
	<<Else>>
	  You are a professor. 
	  This email body is sent only to professors.
	<</If>>

	  Regards,
	  <<AuthorName>>
</XMP>

<br/>

It is not possible to use <i>if-then-else</i> inside another <i>if-then-else</i>.
